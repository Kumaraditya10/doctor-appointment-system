A full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that enables patients to search doctors, view availability, and book appointments online. The platform supports role-based access: patients can manage bookings, doctors can handle schedules, and admins oversee the system. With JWT authentication, secure backend, and a responsive React frontend, it ensures privacy, reliability, and a seamless user experience. This system reduces manual scheduling, avoids conflicts, and improves overall healthcare efficiency.
